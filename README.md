# BaruchJavaClass

I am currently taking a 1 month long Java class for New Programmers at Baruch College in New York City. 
The instructor is Colin Steel.
So far we have made a program that sings the "99 Bottles of Beer" song, tested out Arrays, 
created a game of Battleship, and made a Sorter.

I had a lot of trouble with the game of Battleship, and it's still not functional, so I'm going to wait until we work
it out in class before I post it up here.

The Sorter was homework for the class coming up tomorrow, but I'm pretty proud of what I did. I look forward to
finding out what Colin's solution to this one is.

The textbook we're reading for this class is "Head First Java", which is well-written and quite engaging, although
I still often feel over my head about the whole thing.
